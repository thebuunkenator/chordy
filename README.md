# chordy
this is still an early, early alpha version :)

ChordPro parser for the web. Styling is done with CSS.

Purpose is to integrate different file formats for:
- chordpro style/chords and lyrics
- nice viewer and integration of tabs
- measure oriented tabs (usage of '|' to indicate measures
- chordcharts (no lyrics)
- optional slash-rhythm notation

Most of which are not implemented yet.
